Graceful degradation begins with more complex components, and works down toward basic stylistic compenents. Service workers process network requests to carry out functionality when interenet is inaccessible. The concept of graceful degradation relates to service workers by providing the ability to check if certain added compnenents work if network access is not possible. As a developer is working on incorrporating additional simple features in the application, service workers aid in evaluating the performance and resilliance of the product.
